# Initial Concept

**Project Name:** ShadowRunner (PWA Version)
**Type:** Gamified Running Progressive Web App (Mobile First)
**Core Concept:** A survival running game where the user must run to a specific location on a map to "escape," while revealing the map (Fog of War) and being chased by a virtual entity.

## Target Audience
- **Casual Runners:** Individuals seeking to gamify their exercise routine to stay motivated.
- **Fitness Gamers:** Gamers who enjoy immersive experiences and want to translate that into physical activity.

## Product Goals
- **Immersive Survival:** Transform running into a high-stakes escape mission through audio-visual feedback and real-time threats.
- **Reliable Tracking:** Provide accurate logging of essential run metrics (distance, pace, time).
- **Gamified Progression:** Encourage repeat usage through personal record chasing and shared exploration milestones.

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Fog of War:** A real-time map mask that reveals as the user runs, with persistence stored locally via IndexedDB.
- **Extraction Mechanics:** Randomly generated target locations with a survival-style navigation compass guiding the user through the dark.
- **The Shadow:** A virtual pursuer that closes in based on time vs. distance, triggering red pulsing visual effects and proximity warnings.
- **Social & Competition:** 
    - **Ghost Runs:** Ability to race against personal bests.
    - **Discovery Sync:** Shared map discovery progress with friends to foster a sense of community exploration.

## Visual & Emotional Identity
- **Style:** Industrial/Gritty. High contrast, muted tones, and a tactical, high-stakes tactical interface.
- **Experience:** Tension-filled, focused, and rewarding upon successful "extraction."
