# Product Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- **Urgent & Tactical:** All communication within the app should use the persona of a tactical survival assistant. Messages should be concise, authoritative, and focused on immediate survival objectives (e.g., "Anomaly detected. Move to extraction immediately.").

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette (Tactical Monochrome & Pulse):**
    - **Primary:** Deep slates, charcoals, and obsidian blacks to provide a dark, gritty background.
    - **Accent:** A single high-intensity "Hazard" Neon Red/Orange used exclusively for critical alerts, pathfinding, and the "Shadow" presence.
- **UI Layout (HUD-Style Overlays):** Minimalist, semi-transparent overlays that mimic a tactical heads-up display. UI elements should feel like digital projections over the "Fog of War" map.
- **Visual Fidelity:** Prioritize high-quality map textures, glowing neon particle effects for revealed areas, and smooth, high-frame-rate transitions to maximize immersion and "premium" feel.

## Audio Experience
- **Spatialized Soundscapes:** Proximity to the Shadow is communicated via visceral, spatialized audio. A low-frequency heartbeat and distorted "whispers" will increase in volume and tempo as the threat nears, allowing for eyes-up navigation.

## Experience Principles
- **Atmospheric Immersion:** Every design choice—from typography to sound—must reinforce the feeling of being a tactical operative in a high-stakes environment.
- **Visual Reward:** The act of "erasing the darkness" should be a primary visual satisfaction point, utilizing glowing neon "trails" to mark discovered territory.
- **Unambiguous Danger:** High-contrast "Hazard Red" pulses and intensifying audio ensure the user instantly recognizes life-or-death scenarios without needing to read detailed text.
